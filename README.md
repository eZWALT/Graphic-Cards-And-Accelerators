# TGA Project: Parallel Merge Sort (OpenCL vs CUDA)

## Introduction

This project explores different implementations of the Merge Sort algorithm, combined with Insertion Sort (Also known was MultiSort), to enhance performance.

The main objectives were:

- **Implement and compare**: Develop a parallel version of the MultiSort algorithm in CUDA and compare it with the sequential version.
- **Explore PathMerge**: Implement and evaluate a lesser-known parallel variant of the Merge Sort algorithm called *PathMerge*.
- **Evaluate OpenCL vs. CUDA**: Test the OpenCL API and conduct a comparative analysis against CUDA to understand their respective strengths and limitations.

## Execution

For detailed instructions on running the experiments, see `experiments/README.md`.
